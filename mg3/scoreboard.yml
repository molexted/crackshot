# ##### UltimateSurvivalGames Scoreboard Configuration #####
# 
# How does this work?
# For each game phase (WAITING,VOTING,COOLDOWN,INGAME and DEATHMATHCH) is a scoreboard design.
# If you set "Enabled" for a phase to false, no scoreboard will shown!
# The title can be maximal 32 charakters long and cannot contain variables.
# 
# In the "Scores" part, you can modify the content of the scoreboard. "//" splits the line in name and score.
# The left part is the name which can be maximal 48 charalters long.
# The right part is the amount of a score. Here you have to write the variables.
# 
# What are the variables?
# You can use many variables. Here is a list:
# 
#   %playing% - The current amount of players in a lobby!
#   %requiredplayers% - The amount of required players to start a game automaticly!
#   %death% - The amount of deaths in a round!
#   %spectators% - The amount of spectators in a round!
#   %time% - The remaining time of a game phase!
#   %votecount% - The amount of votes of an arena (Only works in the voting phase)
#   %arena% - The name of the arena (Only works in the score name)
