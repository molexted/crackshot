# ##### UltimateSurvivalGames Chestloot Configuration #####
# 
# ## How does this work? ##
# The chestloot is splitted into 5 lists. You can add unlimited items to each list.
# In one chest can spawn up to 8 different items. For each itemstack, the plugin chooses from
# one list. Each list has different chances for items spawning in that list:
# 
# Level 1: 40 %
# Level 2: 30 %
# Level 3: 15 %
# Level 4: 10 %
# Level 5: 5 %
# 
# If the plugin has choosed a list for an itemstack, it takes an item random from the list.
# 
# ## How can I modify the items? ##
# You can add or remove items from all lists. But at least one item has to be on each list.
# 
# ## How do I format the items? ##
# MATERIAL/ITEMID[:SUBID] [AMOUNT] [SPECIAL THINGS]
# Here are some examples:
# 
# # Normal Item:
# "BREAD" - is the same like "BREAD 1", "BREAD:0 1" or "297:0 1"
# 
# # If you want to set a predefined durability-level, just change the subid:
# "STONE_SWORD:10" - This tool has already 10 uses lost.
# 
# # You can also add enchantments to an item:
# "STONE_SWORD enchant:KNOCKBACK,2 enchant:DAMAGE_ALL,3" - This item has knockback 2 and sharpness 3! Note: Only the vanilla level of an enchantment can be used!
# 
# # You can also set a custom name and lore for an item:
# "EGG name:&eEaster_Egg lore:&7Throw//&7me!" - This is an egg with a displayname "Easter Egg" and the lore "Throw me"! Note: Spaces are "_" and line breaks in lore the charakters "//"
